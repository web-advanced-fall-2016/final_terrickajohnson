Sonic Graffiti Demo

![Alt text](screenshot.png?raw=true "Optional Title")


Sonic Graffiti is a collaborative arts repository for a post-modern society. Building on the connection between social activism and hip-hop culture, Sonic Graffiti provides a platform for connecting sonic and visual artists while also serving as an archival tool for said artists.

Creators are able to use midi controllers and analog sensors to produce sound and artwork in webpage to develop collaborative experience between a musicians and visual artists.

While visual artists control color (mood), musicians control the sound of the web page. Each hit on a midi controllers stores the current color code along with the corresponding keynote from the midi device. This is saved into a database for later access.

Technology for this Project:
RFduino,
Raspberry Pi,
Arduino,
Socket IO,
Web Midi JS

Future Iterations:
Add playback of midi notes and colors,
Think of more interesting ways to display the relationship between sonic and visual.

Future Technologies to be considered:
Web Sockets,
Paper JS / D3 JS
Max MSP
